# MAIA Dashboard Documentation

The MAIA Dashboard is a web-based application that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the MAIA platform. The dashboard allows users to request project allocations, link their account to a project, and access the project-specific tools and resources.

Additionaly, the MAIA Dashboard is used to manage a number of platform operations, such as user, project, and resource management, as well as monitoring and logging.


## User Management

### Registering a New User

To register a new user, the user must fill out the registration form with their username and email address. The request is then sent to the administrators for approval.
MAIA administrators can approve the user registration request by clicking on the "ID" icon, the top one next to the user entry. By clicking on the "ID" icon, the corresponding Keycloak user will be created and the user will be able to log in to the MAIA Dashboard. Once the User is correctly registered to Keycloak, the same icon will be replaced by a green check mark.

### Linking a User to an Existing Project

The user can link their account in the registration form, where they can select the project they want to be linked to. 
In the Users page, MAIA administrators can approve the user liking request to a project by clicking on the "group" icon, the middle one next to the user entry. By clicking on the "group" icon. By clicking on the "group" icon, the corresponding Keycloak user will be assigned to the Keycloak group corresponding to the project. Once the User is correctly linked to the project, the same icon will be replaced by a green check mark.
A list of all the users part of the project is available in the same page

</p>
If a user wishes to be removed from a project, administrators can unlink the user by updating the project list in the user's entry and clicking the unlink icon. Once unlinked, the user will lose access to the project's resources and tools.



## Project Management

### Approving Project Requests

Users can request a new project by filling out the project request form. The request is then sent to the administrators for approval.
The requested project will appear in the Projects and Users pages, where MAIA administrators can approve it by registering the corresponding Keycloak group and deploying the MAIA Namespace in the cluster. The Keycloak group will be created by clicking on the "group" icon, the top one on the first column next to the project entry.

### Deploying Projects [ArgoCD and Re-Sync]
The MAIA Namespace can be deployed by clicking on the "deploy" icon, on the second column next to the project entry. By clicking on the "deploy" icon, the corresponding ArgoCD application will be created and the project will be deployed in the cluster. Once the Project is correctly registered to Keycloak and deployed in the cluster, the same icons will be replaced by the "update" button.

IMPORTANT!

If MAIA is deployed as an extension in Kaapana, you will need to enable the corresponding project namespace in the Traefik deployment(in the `admin` namespace):
```bash
--providers.kubernetesingress.namespaces=admin,jobs,services,extensions,<project_1>,<project_2>,...
```

### Deleting Projects

Upon completion of a project, the MAIA administrators can delete the project. This is done in two steps:
1. Deleting the Keycloak group: This is done by clicking on the "Delete" button. By clicking on the "Delete" button, the corresponding Keycloak group will be deleted and the users will no longer be associated with the group.
2. Manually deleting the ArgoCD applications: this must be done manually by the MAIA administrators, by going to the ArgoCD dashboard and deleting the corresponding applications. Once the applications and the ArgoCD project are deleted, the administrators can delete the namespace in the cluster.


## Resource Management

### Monitoring Cluster Status
The MAIA Dashboard Home page provides an overview of the MAIA cluster status, with one table for each cluster. The tables display the number of nodes per cluster and their current status (e.g., Ready, NotReady, UnderMaintenance). In addition, for each cluster, it is possible to navigate to the cluster's available monitoring services, such as Grafana and Kubernetes Dashboard, and other relevant applications, such as the Traefik dashboard, Rancher, ArgoCD, Keycloak and the Harbor registry.

### Monitoring GPU Allocations

The MAIA Dashboard features a *Resources* page dedicated to tracking GPU usage across all projects. This page displays a table listing each allocated GPU, the associated project, and the requesting user, enabling administrators to monitor GPU utilization and optimize resource allocation.

Additionally, a filter below the GPU allocation table allows administrators to sort nodes by requested resources, including CPU, Memory, and GPU. This makes it easy to identify nodes that match specific requirements and locate available computing resources within the clusters.


### GPU Booking System

This system is implemented only for a subset of GPUs. The way it works is that users need to book a GPU in order to be able to use it. TThe booking is done through the *Book a GPU* page, where the user inserts the required information, such as the project, the GPU type, and the booking duration. Once the booking is confirmed, the user will receive an email notification with the booking details.
The booked GPU will be displayed in the *My GPU Booking* page, where the user can see the status of their bookings and any relevant information.
It is also possible to cancel a booking, which will free up the GPU for other users. The cancellation can be done by clicking on the "Delete" button next to the booking entry in the *My GPU Booking* page.

## Automatic Email Notifications

Automatic email notifications are used to welcome new users, notify them of project approvals, and inform them about resource allocations (including the GPU Booking system). The email notifications are sent to the user's registered email address and contain important information about their account and project status.

To enable email notifications, the MAIA administrators must configure the email settings in the MAIA Dashboard. This includes setting up the SMTP server, sender email address, and other relevant parameters:
```yaml
email_account:  <SMTP email address>
email_smtp_server: <SMTP server address>
email_password: <SMTP server password>
```
or, in the `maia_config.yaml` file:

```yaml
email_server_credentials:
  email_account: 
  email_password: 
  email_smtp_server:
```
