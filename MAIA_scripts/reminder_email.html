    <p>Dear MAIA User,</p>

    <p>We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to all active MAIA users to remind you of some important
        steps and to introduce new routines to improve efficiency for both users and maintainers of the MAIA platform.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Project Registration:</strong></p>
    <p>If you are starting a research work and you want to have it hosted in MAIA, please first register your project
        here:<br>
        <a href="{https://maia.app.cloud.cbh.kth.se/maia/register_project/}">MAIA Project Registration</a>
    </p>

    <p><strong>User Registration:</strong></p>
    <p>To create a user account, an active project must be available to select. Once a project is registered, you can
        sign up for an account linked to that project here:<br>
        <a href="{https://maia.app.cloud.cbh.kth.se/maia/register/}">MAIA User Registration</a>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Support:</strong></p>
    <p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please join our Discord community:<br>
        <a href="{https://discord.gg/ZSe2dDzt}">MAIA Support Discord</a>
    </p>

    <p>We are trying to standardize the process of registering new users and projects as well as helping out with any
        issues. We will use the Discord channel linked above as the primary way to get help with your workspace and ask
        everyone using MAIA to sign up there with the link to reach us. This way, you will be able to see directly if
        anyone has a similar problem, how to solve it and get help as soon as possible. For this reason, you may also be
        referred there if you use some other way to contact us.</p>
