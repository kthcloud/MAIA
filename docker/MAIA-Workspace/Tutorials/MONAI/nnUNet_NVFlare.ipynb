    "# nnUNet Experiment in NVFlare\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through the process of running a nnUNet experiment in a Federated Learning context, by using the NVIDIA Flare API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the nnUNet framework to train a model on a dataset that is distributed across multiple sites. The training will be done in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, by using the Federated Learning capabilities of the NVIDIA Flare API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, the following steps will be performed:\n",
    "1. Dataset Preparation: The dataset in the different sites will be prepared for training, harmonizing the data and creating the necessary files for training according to the nnUNet framework.\n",
    "2. nnUNet Experiment Planning and Preprocessing: One of the sites will be selected as the main site, where the nnUNet experiment will be planned and the data will be preprocessed. This step has to be done only on one site, as the nnUNet plans will be shared with the other sites.\n",
    "3. nnUNet Preprocessing: The data will be preprocessed according to the nnUNet plan in all the other sites.\n",
    "4. nnUNet Training: The model will be trained on the data of all the sites, using the nnUNet framework and aggregating the local gradients from the different sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Offline Training\n",
    "Offline training is also made available for the clients, to test the training process and evaluate the model at each individual site, establishing a baseline before moving on to the Federated Learning phase.\n",
    "In this fase, Data Preparation, Experiment Planning and Preprocessing, Training, Model Conversion, Validation and Packaging will be done on each site separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Deployment\n",
    "In addition, some specific jobs will be executed to:\n",
    "- Convert the model from the MONAI Bundle standard to the nnUNet format.\n",
    "- Validate the model using the nnUNet framework.\n",
    "- Package the model into a MONAI Bundle, ready for deployment.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model across different sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PREREQUISITES\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you have already installed the NVIDIA Flare API and have access to a Federated Learning cluster, with ``Lead`` role. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [Getting Started](../README.md#getting-started) section of the Tutorial section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, all the sites should have the necessary data for training ready in a known location ( not necessarily the same location across all sites)."

    "Once the dataset has been prepared and preprocessed following the nnUNet plans, the nnUNet training is ready to begin. In this phase, we will train an nnUNet model using a MONAI Bundle. It’s important to note that the training at this stage will be conducted separately at each site, with the model saved in the MONAI Bundle format. There will be no aggregation of local gradients and no Federated Learning applied in this step. This approach is intended to test the training process and evaluate the model at each individual site, establishing a baseline before moving on to the Federated Learning phase.\n",
